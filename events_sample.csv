TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. TEDx Sao Paulo is a nonprofit conference that will bring together more than 30 thinkers from areas of knowledge diverse as technology, science and business, to talk about their best ideas in 5 or 15-minute talks. The theme for this first installment of the event is: What does Brazil have to offer the world now? TEDx Sao Paulo will happen on November 14th, 2009, and it will be free of charge."

We saw provocative demos of prototypes that will change the way we commute, care for those in need, and clean the air. We were amazed by products that diagnose diseases and pill caps that remind us to take our meds. We learned how reverse-mentorship and ArtScience culture labs are engaging the next generation of innovators who are reinventing how we work, eat, and have fun. Other highlights included live music, local fare, and our favorites from the TED video archives. We learned how El Sistema USA, winner of the 2009 TED Prize, was beginning to flourish in Boston. And, we were treated to a remarkable finale with Benjamin Zander conducting the Youth Orchestra of the Americas in a breathtaking rendition of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony."
